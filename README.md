# TensorFlow Models

This repository contains machine learning models implemented in
[TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org). The models are maintained by their
respective authors. To propose a model for inclusion, please submit a pull
request.

Currently, the models are compatible with TensorFlow 1.0 or later. If you are
running TensorFlow 0.12 or earlier, please
[upgrade your installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).
