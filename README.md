# Welcome to the Model Garden for TensorFlow

The TensorFlow Model Garden is a repository with a number of different
implementations of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and modeling solutions for
TensorFlow users. We aim to demonstrate the best practices for modeling so that
TensorFlow users can take full advantage of TensorFlow for their research and
product development.

To improve the transparency and reproducibility of our models, training logs on
[TensorBoard.dev](https://tensorboard.dev) are also provided for models to the
extent possible though not all models are suitable.

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [official](official) | • A collection of example implementations for SOTA models using the latest TensorFlow 2's high-level APIs<br />• Officially maintained, supported, and kept up to date with the latest TensorFlow 2 APIs by TensorFlow<br />• Reasonably optimized for fast performance while still being easy to read<br /> For more details on the capabilities, check the guide on the [Model-garden](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfmodels)|
| [research](research) | • A collection of research model implementations in TensorFlow 1 or 2 by researchers<br />• Maintained and supported by researchers |
| [community](community) | • A curated list of the GitHub repositories with machine learning models and implementations powered by TensorFlow 2 |
| [orbit](orbit) | • A flexible and lightweight library that users can easily use or fork when writing customized training loop code in TensorFlow 2.x. It seamlessly integrates with `tf.distribute` and supports running on different device types (CPU, GPU, and TPU). |

## Installation

To install the current release of tensorflow-models, please follow any one of the methods described below.

#### Method 1: Install the TensorFlow Model Garden pip package

<details>

**tf-models-official** is the stable Model Garden package. Please check out the [releases](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/releases) to see what are available modules.

pip3 will install all models and dependencies automatically.

```shell
pip3 install tf-models-official
```

Please check out our examples:
  - [basic library import](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/tensorflow_models/tensorflow_models_pypi.ipynb)
  - [nlp model building](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/docs/nlp/index.ipynb)
to learn how to use a PIP package.

Note that **tf-models-official** may not include the latest changes in the master branch of this
github repo. To include latest changes, you may install **tf-models-nightly**,
which is the nightly Model Garden package created daily automatically.

```shell
pip3 install tf-models-nightly
```

</details>


#### Method 2: Clone the source

<details>

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
```

2. Add the top-level ***/models*** folder to the Python path.

```shell
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/models
```

If you are using in a Windows environment, you may need to use the following command with PowerShell:
```shell
$env:PYTHONPATH += ":\path\to\models"
```

If you are using a Colab notebook, please set the Python path with os.environ.

```python
import os
os.environ['PYTHONPATH'] += ":/path/to/models"
```

3. Install other dependencies

```shell
pip3 install --user -r models/official/requirements.txt
```

Finally, if you are using nlp packages, please also install
**tensorflow-text-nightly**:

```shell
pip3 install tensorflow-text-nightly
```
