# TensorFlow Models

This repository contains a number of different models implemented in [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org):

The [official models](official) are a collection of example models that use TensorFlow's high-level APIs. They are intended to be well-maintained, tested, and kept up-to-date with the latest stable TensorFlow API. They should also be reasonably optimized for fast performance, while maintaining readability. We especially recommend newer TensorFlow users to start here.

The [research models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research) are a large collection of models implemented in TensorFlow by researchers. They are neither officially supported nor available in release branches; individual researchers can decide whether or not to maintain the models and/or provide support on issues and pull requests.

The [samples folder](samples) contains code snippets and smaller models that demonstrate features of TensorFlow, including code presented in various blog posts.

The [tutorials folder](tutorials) is a collection of models described in the [TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/).
