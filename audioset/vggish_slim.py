"""Defines the 'VGGish' model used to generate AudioSet embedding features.

The public AudioSet release (https://research.google.com/audioset/download.html)
includes 128-D features extracted from the embedding layer of a VGG-like model
that was trained on a large Google-internal YouTube dataset. Here we provide
a TF-Slim definition of the same model, without any dependences on libraries
internal to Google. We call it 'VGGish'.

Note that we only define the model up to the embedding layer, which is the
penultimate layer before the final classifier layer. We also provide various
hyperparameter values (in vggish_params.py) that were used to train this model
internally.

For comparison, here is TF-Slim's VGG definition:

  All ops are created in the current default graph, under the scope 'vggish/'.

  The input is a placeholder named 'vggish/input_features' of type float32 and
  shape [batch_size, num_frames, num_bands] where batch_size is variable and
  num_frames and num_bands are constants, and [num_frames, num_bands] represents
  a log-mel-scale spectrogram patch covering num_bands frequency bands and
  num_frames time frames (where each frame step is usually 10ms). This is
  produced by computing the stabilized log(mel-spectrogram + params.LOG_OFFSET).
  The output is an op named 'vggish/embedding' which produces the activations of
  a 128-D embedding layer, which is usually the penultimate layer when used as
  part of a full model with a final classifier layer.

  Args:
    training: If true, all parameters are marked trainable.

  Returns:
    The op 'vggish/embeddings'.
