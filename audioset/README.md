# Models for AudioSet: A Large Scale Dataset of Audio Events

This repository provides models and supporting code associated with
[AudioSet](http://g.co/audioset), a dataset of over 2 million human-labeled
10-second YouTube video soundtracks, with labels taken from an ontology of
more than 600 audio event classes.

AudioSet was
[released](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/03/announcing-audioset-dataset-for-audio.html)
in March 2017 by Google's Sound Understanding team to provide a common
large-scale evaluation task for audio event detection as well as a starting
point for a comprehensive vocabulary of sound events.

For more details about AudioSet and the various models we have trained, please

If you use the pre-trained VGGish model in your published research, we ask that
you cite [CNN Architectures for Large-Scale Audio Classification](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub45611.html).
If you use the AudioSet dataset or the released 128-D embeddings of AudioSet
segments, please cite

## VGGish

The initial AudioSet release included 128-dimensional embeddings of each
AudioSet segment produced from a VGG-like audio classification model that was
trained on a large YouTube dataset (a preliminary version of what later became
[YouTube-8M](https://research.google.com/youtube8m)).

We provide a TensorFlow definition of this model, which we call __*VGGish*__, as
well as supporting code to extract input features for the model from audio
waveforms and to post-process the model embedding output into the same format as
the released embedding features.

### Installation

VGGish depends on the following Python packages:

* [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [`scipy`](http://www.scipy.org/)
* [`resampy`](http://resampy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [`tensorflow`](http://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [`six`](https://pythonhosted.org/six/)

These are all easily installable via, e.g., `pip install numpy` (as in the
example command sequence below).

Any reasonably recent version of these packages should work. TensorFlow should
be at least version 1.0.  We have tested with Python 2.7.6 and 3.4.3 on an
Ubuntu-like system with NumPy v1.13.1, SciPy v0.19.1, resampy v0.1.5, TensorFlow
v1.2.1, and Six v1.10.0.

VGGish also requires downloading two data files:

* [VGGish model checkpoint](https://storage.googleapis.com/audioset/vggish_model.ckpt),
  in TensorFlow checkpoint format.
* [Embedding PCA parameters](https://storage.googleapis.com/audioset/vggish_pca_params.npz),
  in NumPy compressed archive format.

After downloading these files into the same directory as this README, the
installation can be tested by running `python vggish_smoke_test.py` which
runs a known signal through the model and checks the output.

Here's a sample installation and test session:

```shell
# You can optionally install and test VGGish within a Python virtualenv, which
# is useful for isolating changes from the rest of your system. For example, you
# may have an existing version of some packages that you do not want to upgrade,
# or you want to try Python 3 instead of Python 2. If you decide to use a
# virtualenv, you can create one by running
#   $ virtualenv vggish   # For Python 2
# or
#   $ python3 -m venv vggish # For Python 3
# and then enter the virtual environment by running
#   $ source vggish/bin/activate  # Assuming you use bash
# Leave the virtual environment at the end of the session by running
#   $ deactivate

# Upgrade pip first.
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install dependences. Resampy needs to be installed after NumPy and SciPy
# are already installed.
$ pip install numpy scipy
$ pip install resampy tensorflow six

# Clone TensorFlow models repo into a 'models' directory.
$ git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
$ cd models/audioset
# Download data files into same directory as code.
$ curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/audioset/vggish_model.ckpt
$ curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/audioset/vggish_pca_params.npz

# Installation ready, let's test it.
$ python vggish_smoke_test.py
# If we see "Looks Good To Me", then we're all set.
```

### Usage

VGGish can be used in two ways:

* *As a feature extractor*: VGGish converts audio input features into a
  semantically meaningful, high-level 128-D embedding which can be fed as input
  to a downstream classification model. The downstream model can be shallower
  than usual because the VGGish embedding is more semantically compact than raw
  audio features.

  So, for example, you could train a classifier for 10 of the AudioSet classes
  by using the released embeddings as features.  Then, you could use that
  trained classifier with any arbitrary audio input by running the audio through
  the audio feature extractor and VGGish model provided here, passing the
  resulting embedding features as input to your trained model.
  `vggish_inference_demo.py` shows how to produce VGGish embeddings from
  arbitrary audio.

* *As part of a larger model*: Here, we treat VGGish as a "warm start" for the
  lower layers of a model that takes audio features as input and adds more
  layers on top of the VGGish embedding. This can be used to fine-tune VGGish
  (or parts thereof) if you have large datasets that might be very different
  from the typical YouTube video clip. `vggish_train_demo.py` shows how to add
  layers on top of VGGish and train the whole model.

### About the Model

The VGGish code layout is as follows:

* `vggish_slim.py`: Model definition in TensorFlow Slim notation.
* `vggish_params.py`: Hyperparameters.
* `vggish_input.py`: Converter from audio waveform into input examples.
* `mel_features.py`: Audio feature extraction helpers.
* `vggish_postprocess.py`: Embedding postprocessing.
* `vggish_inference_demo.py`: Demo of VGGish in inference mode.
* `vggish_train_demo.py`: Demo of VGGish in training mode.
* `vggish_smoke_test.py`: Simple test of a VGGish installation

#### Architecture

See `vggish_slim.py` and `vggish_params.py`.

VGGish is a variant of the [VGG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) model, in
particular Configuration A with 11 weight layers. Specifically, here are the
changes we made:

* The input size was changed to 96x64 for log mel spectrogram audio inputs.

* We drop the last group of convolutional and maxpool layers, so we now have
  only four groups of convolution/maxpool layers instead of five.

* Instead of a 1000-wide fully connected layer at the end, we use a 128-wide
  fully connected layer. This acts as a compact embedding layer.

The model definition provided here defines layers up to and including the
128-wide embedding layer.

#### Input: Audio Features

See `vggish_input.py` and `mel_features.py`.

VGGish was trained with audio features computed as follows:

* All audio is resampled to 16 kHz mono.
* A spectrogram is computed using magnitudes of the Short-Time Fourier Transform
  with a window size of 25 ms, a window hop of 10 ms, and a periodic Hann
  window.
* A mel spectrogram is computed by mapping the spectrogram to 64 mel bins
  covering the range 125-7500 Hz.
* A stabilized log mel spectrogram is computed by applying
  log(mel-spectrum + 0.01) where the offset is used to avoid taking a logarithm
  of zero.
* These features are then framed into non-overlapping examples of 0.96 seconds,
  where each example covers 64 mel bands and 96 frames of 10 ms each.

We provide our own NumPy implementation that produces features that are very
similar to those produced by our internal production code. This results in
embedding outputs that are closely match the embeddings that we have already
released. Note that these embeddings will *not* be bit-for-bit identical to the
released embeddings due to small differences between the feature computation
code paths, and even between two different installations of VGGish with
different underlying libraries and hardware. However, we expect that the
embeddings will be equivalent in the context of a downstream classification
task.

#### Output: Embeddings

See `vggish_postprocess.py`.

The released AudioSet embeddings were postprocessed before release by applying a
PCA transformation (which performs both PCA and whitening) as well as
quantization to 8 bits per embedding element. This was done to be compatible
with the [YouTube-8M](https://research.google.com/youtube8m) project which has
released visual and audio embeddings for millions of YouTube videos in the same
PCA/whitened/quantized format.

We provide a Python implementation of the postprocessing which can be applied to
batches of embeddings produced by VGGish. `vggish_inference_demo.py` shows how
the postprocessor can be run after inference.

If you don't need to use the released embeddings or YouTube-8M, then you could
skip postprocessing and use raw embeddings.

### Future Work

you plan to do before you invest a lot of time, to get feedback from us and the
rest of the community.
