This directory contains functions for creating recurrent neural networks
and sequence-to-sequence models. Detailed instructions on how to get started
and use them are available in the tutorials.

* [RNN Tutorial](http://tensorflow.org/tutorials/recurrent/index.md)

Trains the model described in:
(Zaremba, et. al.) Recurrent Neural Network Regularization
http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2329

There are 3 supported model configurations:
===========================================
| config | epochs | train | valid  | test
===========================================
| small  | 13     | 37.99 | 121.39 | 115.91
| medium | 39     | 48.45 |  86.16 |  82.07
| large  | 55     | 37.87 |  82.62 |  78.29
The exact results may vary depending on the random initialization.

The hyperparameters used in the model:
- init_scale - the initial scale of the weights
- learning_rate - the initial value of the learning rate
- max_grad_norm - the maximum permissible norm of the gradient
- num_layers - the number of LSTM layers
- num_steps - the number of unrolled steps of LSTM
- hidden_size - the number of LSTM units
- max_epoch - the number of epochs trained with the initial learning rate
- max_max_epoch - the total number of epochs for training
- keep_prob - the probability of keeping weights in the dropout layer
- lr_decay - the decay of the learning rate for each epoch after "max_epoch"
- batch_size - the batch size

The data required for this example is in the data/ dir of the
PTB dataset from Tomas Mikolov's webpage:

$ wget http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~imikolov/rnnlm/simple-examples.tgz
$ tar xvf simple-examples.tgz

To run:

$ python ptb_word_lm.py --data_path=simple-examples/data/
