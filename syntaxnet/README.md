# SyntaxNet: Neural Models of Syntax.

*A TensorFlow toolkit for deep learning powered natural language understanding
(NLU).*

**CoNLL**: See [here](g3doc/conll2017/README.md) for instructions for using the
SyntaxNet/DRAGNN baseline for the CoNLL2017 Shared Task.

At Google, we spend a lot of time thinking about how computer systems can read
and understand human language in order to process it in intelligent ways. We are
excited to share the fruits of our research with the broader community by
releasing SyntaxNet, an open-source neural network framework for
[TensorFlow](http://www.tensorflow.org) that provides a foundation for Natural
Language Understanding (NLU) systems. Our release includes all the code needed
to train new SyntaxNet models on your own data, as well as a suite of models
that we have trained for you, and that you can use to analyze text in over 40
languages.

This repository is largely divided into two sub-packages:

1.  **DRAGNN:
    [code](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/syntaxnet/dragnn),
    [documentation](g3doc/DRAGNN.md),
    [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04474.pdf)** implements Dynamic Recurrent
    Acyclic Graphical Neural Networks (DRAGNN), a framework for building
    multi-task, fully dynamically constructed computation graphs. Practically, we
    use DRAGNN to extend our prior work from [Andor et al.
    (2016)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06042) with end-to-end, deep recurrent
    models and to provide a much easier to use interface to SyntaxNet. *DRAGNN
    is designed first and foremost as a Python library, and therefore much
    easier to use than the original SyntaxNet implementation.*

1.  **SyntaxNet:
    [code](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/syntaxnet/syntaxnet),
    [documentation](g3doc/syntaxnet-tutorial.md)** is a transition-based
    framework for natural language processing, with core functionality for
    feature extraction, representing annotated data, and evaluation. As of the
    DRAGNN release, it is recommended to train and deploy SyntaxNet models using
    the DRAGNN framework.

## How to use this library

There are three ways to use SyntaxNet:

*   See [here](g3doc/conll2017/README.md) for instructions for using the
    SyntaxNet/DRAGNN baseline for the CoNLL2017 Shared Task, and running the
    ParseySaurus models.
*   You can use DRAGNN to train your NLP models for other tasks and dataset. See
    "Getting started with DRAGNN" below.
*   You can continue to use the Parsey McParseface family of pre-trained
    SyntaxNet models. See "Pre-trained NLP models" below.

## Installation

### Docker installation

The simplest way to get started with DRAGNN is by loading our Docker container.
[Here](g3doc/CLOUD.md) is a tutorial for running the DRAGNN container on
[GCP](https://cloud.google.com) (just as applicable to your own computer).

### Manual installation

Running and training SyntaxNet/DRAGNN models requires building this package from
source. You'll need to install:

*   python 2.7:
    *   Python 3 support is not available yet
*   bazel:
    *   Follow the instructions [here](http://bazel.build/docs/install.html)
    *   Alternately, Download bazel <.deb> from
        [https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases)
        for your system configuration.
    *   Install it using the command: sudo dpkg -i <.deb file>
    *   Check for the bazel version by typing: bazel version
*   swig:
    *   `apt-get install swig` on Ubuntu
    *   `brew install swig` on OSX
*   protocol buffers, with a version supported by TensorFlow:
    *   check your protobuf version with `pip freeze | grep protobuf`
    *   upgrade to a supported version with `pip install -U protobuf==3.3.0`
*   mock, the testing package:
    *   `pip install mock`
*   asciitree, to draw parse trees on the console for the demo:
    *   `pip install asciitree`
*   numpy, package for scientific computing:
    *   `pip install numpy`
*   pygraphviz to visualize traces and parse trees:
    *   `apt-get install -y graphviz libgraphviz-dev`
    *   `pip install pygraphviz
        --install-option="--include-path=/usr/include/graphviz"
        --install-option="--library-path=/usr/lib/graphviz/"`

Once you completed the above steps, you can build and test SyntaxNet with the
following commands:

```shell
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
  cd models/syntaxnet/tensorflow
  ./configure
  cd ..
  bazel test ...
  # On Mac, run the following:
  bazel test --linkopt=-headerpad_max_install_names \
    dragnn/... syntaxnet/... util/utf8/...
```
Bazel should complete reporting all tests passed.

Now you can install the SyntaxNet and DRAGNN Python modules with the following commands:
```shell
  mkdir /tmp/syntaxnet_pkg
  bazel-bin/dragnn/tools/build_pip_package --output-dir=/tmp/syntaxnet_pkg
  #  The filename of the .whl depends on your platform.
  sudo pip install /tmp/syntaxnet_pkg/syntaxnet-x.xx-none-any.whl
```

To build SyntaxNet with GPU support please refer to the instructions in
[issues/248](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/248).



**Note:** If you are running Docker on OSX, make sure that you have enough
memory allocated for your Docker VM.

## Getting Started

We have a few guides on this README, as well as more extensive
[documentation](g3doc/).

### Learning the DRAGNN framework

![DRAGNN](g3doc/unrolled-dragnn.png)

An easy and visual way to get started with DRAGNN is to run our Jupyter
notebooks for [interactive
debugging](examples/dragnn/interactive_text_analyzer.ipynb) and [training a new
model](examples/dragnn/trainer_tutorial.ipynb). Our tutorial
[here](g3doc/CLOUD.md) explains how to start it up from the Docker container.
Once you have DRAGNN installed and running, try out the
[ParseySaurus](g3doc/conll2017) models.

### Using the Pre-trained NLP models

We are happy to release *Parsey McParseface*, an English parser that we have
trained for you, and that you can use to analyze English text, along with
[trained models for 40 languages](g3doc/universal.md) and support for text
segmentation and morphological analysis.

Once you have successfully built SyntaxNet, you can start parsing text right
away with Parsey McParseface, located under `syntaxnet/models`. The easiest
thing is to use or modify the included script `syntaxnet/demo.sh`, which shows a
basic setup to parse English taking plain text as input.

You can also skip right away to the [detailed SyntaxNet
tutorial](g3doc/syntaxnet-tutorial.md).

How accurate is Parsey McParseface? For the initial release, we tried to balance
a model that runs fast enough to be useful on a single machine (e.g. ~600
words/second on a modern desktop) and that is also the most accurate parser
available. Here's how Parsey McParseface compares to the academic literature on
several different English domains: (all numbers are % correct head assignments
in the tree, or unlabelled attachment score)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :---: | :-------:
[Martins et al. (2013)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/TurboParser/)                                                | 93.10 | 88.23 | 94.21
[Zhang and McDonald (2014)](http://research.google.com/pubs/archive/38148.pdf)                                  | 93.32 | 88.65 | 93.37

[Andor et al. (2016)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06042)*                                                         | 94.44 | 90.17 | 95.40
Parsey McParseface                                                                                              | 94.15 | 89.08 | 94.77

We see that Parsey McParseface is state-of-the-art; more importantly, with
SyntaxNet you can train larger networks with more hidden units and bigger beam
sizes if you want to push the accuracy even further: [Andor et al.
(2016)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06042)* is simply a SyntaxNet model with a
larger beam and network. For futher information on the datasets, see that paper
under the section "Treebank Union".

Parsey McParseface is also state-of-the-art for part-of-speech (POS) tagging
(numbers below are per-token accuracy):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: | :---: | :-------:
[Ling et al. (2015)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lingwang/papers/emnlp2015.pdf) | 97.44 | 94.03 | 96.18
[Andor et al. (2016)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06042)*                    | 97.77 | 94.80 | 96.86
Parsey McParseface                                                         | 97.52 | 94.24 | 96.45

#### Parsing from Standard Input

Simply pass one sentence per line of text into the script at
`syntaxnet/demo.sh`. The script will break the text into words, run the POS
tagger, run the parser, and then generate an ASCII version of the parse tree:

```shell
echo 'Bob brought the pizza to Alice.' | syntaxnet/demo.sh

Input: Bob brought the pizza to Alice .
Parse:
brought VBD ROOT
 +-- Bob NNP nsubj
 +-- pizza NN dobj
 |   +-- the DT det
 +-- to IN prep
 |   +-- Alice NNP pobj
 +-- . . punct
```

The ASCII tree shows the text organized as in the parse, not left-to-right as
visualized in our tutorial graphs. In this example, we see that the verb
"brought" is the root of the sentence, with the subject "Bob", the object
"pizza", and the prepositional phrase "to Alice".

If you want to feed in tokenized, CONLL-formatted text, you can run `demo.sh
--conll`.

#### Annotating a Corpus

To change the pipeline to read and write to specific files (as opposed to piping
through stdin and stdout), we have to modify the `demo.sh` to point to the files
we want. The SyntaxNet models are configured via a combination of run-time flags
(which are easy to change) and a text format `TaskSpec` protocol buffer. The
spec file used in the demo is in
`syntaxnet/models/parsey_mcparseface/context.pbtxt`.

To use corpora instead of stdin/stdout, we have to:

1.  Create or modify an `input` field inside the `TaskSpec`, with the
    `file_pattern` specifying the location we want. If the input corpus is in
    CONLL format, make sure to put `record_format: 'conll-sentence'`.
1.  Change the `--input` and/or `--output` flag to use the name of the resource
    as the output, instead of `stdin` and `stdout`.

E.g., if we wanted to POS tag the CONLL corpus `./wsj.conll`, we would create
two entries, one for the input and one for the output:

```protosame
input {
  name: 'wsj-data'
  record_format: 'conll-sentence'
  Part {
    file_pattern: './wsj.conll'
  }
}
input {
  name: 'wsj-data-tagged'
  record_format: 'conll-sentence'
  Part {
    file_pattern: './wsj-tagged.conll'
  }
}
```

Then we can use `--input=wsj-data --output=wsj-data-tagged` on the command line
to specify reading and writing to these files.

#### Configuring the Python Scripts

As mentioned above, the python scripts are configured in two ways:

1.  **Run-time flags** are used to point to the `TaskSpec` file, switch between
    inputs for reading and writing, and set various run-time model parameters.
    At training time, these flags are used to set the learning rate, hidden
    layer sizes, and other key parameters.
1.  The **`TaskSpec` proto** stores configuration about the transition system,
    the features, and a set of named static resources required by the parser. It
    is specified via the `--task_context` flag. A few key notes to remember:

    -   The `Parameter` settings in the `TaskSpec` have a prefix: either
        `brain_pos` (they apply to the tagger) or `brain_parser` (they apply to
        the parser). The `--prefix` run-time flag switches between reading from
        the two configurations.
    -   The resources will be created and/or modified during multiple stages of
        training. As described above, the resources can also be used at
        evaluation time to read or write to specific files. These resources are
        also separate from the model parameters, which are saved separately via
        calls to TensorFlow ops, and loaded via the `--model_path` flag.
    -   Because the `TaskSpec` contains file path, remember that copying around
        this file is not enough to relocate a trained model: you need to move
        and update all the paths as well.

Note that some run-time flags need to be consistent between training and testing
(e.g. the number of hidden units).

### Next Steps

There are many ways to extend this framework, e.g. adding new features, changing
the model structure, training on other languages, etc. We suggest reading the
detailed tutorial below to get a handle on the rest of the framework.
