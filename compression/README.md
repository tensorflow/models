# Compression with Neural Networks

This is a [TensorFlow](http://www.tensorflow.org/) model repo containing
research on compression with neural networks. This repo currently contains 
code for the following papers:

[Full Resolution Image Compression with Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05148)

## Organization
[Image Encoder](image_encoder/): Encoding and decoding images into their binary representation.

[Entropy Coder](entropy_coder/): Lossless compression of the binary representation.
