For example, we could be identifying the location and boundaries of people within an image or identifying cell nuclei from an image. Formally, image segmentation refers to the process of partitioning an image into a set of pixels that we desire to identify (our target) and the background. \n",

We'll also implement **dice coefficient** (which is used for our loss) and **mean intersection over union**, that will help us monitor our training process and judge how well we are performing. \n",

        "# Build our input pipeline with `tf.data`\n",
        "Since we begin with filenames, we will need to build a robust and scalable data pipeline that will play nicely with our model. If you are unfamiliar with **tf.data** you should check out my other tutorial introducing the concept! \n",
        "\n",
        "### Our input pipeline will consist of the following steps:\n",
        "1. Read the bytes of the file in from the filename - for both the image and the label. Recall that our labels are actually images with each pixel annotated as car or background (1, 0). \n",
        "2. Decode the bytes into an image format\n",
        "3. Apply image transformations: (optional, according to input parameters)\n",
        "  * `resize` - Resize our images to a standard size (as determined by eda or computation/memory restrictions)\n",
        "    * The reason why this is optional is that U-Net is a fully convolutional network (e.g. with no fully connected units) and is thus not dependent on the input size. However, if you choose to not resize the images, you must use a batch size of 1, since you cannot batch variable image size together\n",
        "    * Alternatively, you could also bucket your images together and resize them per mini-batch to avoid resizing images as much, as resizing may affect your performance through interpolation, etc.\n",
        "  * `hue_delta` - Adjusts the hue of an RGB image by a random factor. This is only applied to the actual image (not our label image). The `hue_delta` must be in the interval `[0, 0.5]` \n",
        "  * `horizontal_flip` - flip the image horizontally along the central axis with a 0.5 probability. This transformation must be applied to both the label and the actual image. \n",
        "  * `width_shift_range` and `height_shift_range` are ranges (as a fraction of total width or height) within which to randomly translate the image either horizontally or vertically. This transformation must be applied to both the label and the actual image. \n",
        "  * `rescale` - rescale the image by a certain factor, e.g. 1/ 255.\n",
        "4. Shuffle the data, repeat the data (so we can iterate over it multiple times across epochs), batch the data, then prefetch a batch (for efficiency).\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to note that these transformations that occur in your data pipeline must be symbolic transformations. "

During training time, our model would never see twice the exact same picture. This helps prevent [overfitting](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#overfitting) and helps the model generalize better to unseen data."

In addition, it works well with small datasets and is relatively robust against overfitting as the training data is in terms of the number of patches within an image, which is much larger than the number of training images itself. Unlike the original model, we will add batch normalization to each of our blocks. \n",

The encoder portion is composed of a linear stack of [`Conv`](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#convolution), `BatchNorm`, and [`Relu`](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#ReLU) operations followed by a [`MaxPool`](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#pooling). Each `MaxPool` will reduce the spatial resolution of our feature map by a factor of 2. We keep track of the outputs of each block as we feed these high resolution feature maps with the decoder portion. The Decoder portion is comprised of UpSampling2D, Conv, BatchNorm, and Relus. Note that we concatenate the feature map of the same size on the decoder side. Finally, we add a final Conv operation that performs a convolution along the channels for each individual pixel (kernel size of (1, 1)) that outputs our final segmentation mask in grayscale. \n",
