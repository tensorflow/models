# TensorFlow for Java: Examples

These examples include using pre-trained models for [image
classification](label_image) and [object detection](object_detection),
and driving the [training](training) of a pre-defined model - all using the
TensorFlow Java API.

The TensorFlow Java API does not have feature parity with the Python API.
The Java API is most suitable for inference using pre-trained models
and for training pre-defined models from a single Java process.

Python will be the most convenient language for defining the
numerical computation of a model.
