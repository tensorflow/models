This means the network has not learned the relevant patterns in the training data. \n",

When that is no longer possible, the next best solution is to use techniques like regularization. These place constraints on the quantity and type of information your model can store.  If a network can only afford to memorize a small number of patterns, the optimization process will force it to focus on the most prominent patterns, which have a better chance of generalizing well.\n",

        "The simplest way to prevent overfitting is to reduce the size of the model, i.e. the number of learnable parameters in the model (which is determined by the number of layers and the number of units per layer). In deep learning, the number of learnable parameters in a model is often referred to as the model's \"capacity\". Intuitively, a model with more parameters will have more \"memorization capacity\" and therefore will be able to easily learn a perfect dictionary-like mapping between training samples and their targets, a mapping without any generalization power, but this would be useless when making predictions on previously unseen data. \n",

        "\n",
        "On the other hand, if the network has limited memorization resources, it will not be able to learn the mapping as easily. To minimize its loss, it will have to learn compressed representations that have more predictive power. At the same time, if you make your model too small, it will have difficulty fitting to the training data. There is a balance between \"too much capacity\" and \"not enough capacity\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, there is no magical formula to determine the right size or architecture of your model (in terms of the number of layers, or what the right size for each layer). You will have to experiment using a series of different architectures.\n",
        "\n",
        "To find an appropriate model size, it's best to start with relatively few layers and parameters, then begin increasing the size of the layers or adding new layers until you see diminishing returns on the validation loss. Let's try this on our movie review classification network. \n",

Dropout, applied to a layer, consists of randomly \"dropping out\" (i.e. set to zero) a number of output features of the layer during training. Let's say a given layer would normally have returned a vector [0.2, 0.5, 1.3, 0.8, 1.1] for a given input sample during training; after applying dropout, this vector will have a few zero entries distributed at random, e.g. [0, 0.5, \n",

At test time, no units are dropped out, and instead the layer's output values are scaled down by a factor equal to the dropout rate, so as to balance for the fact that more units are active than at training time.\n",
