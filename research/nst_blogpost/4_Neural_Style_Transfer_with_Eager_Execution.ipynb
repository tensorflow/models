        "In this tutorial, we will learn how to use deep learning to compose images in the style of another image (ever wish you could paint like Picasso or Van Gogh?). This is known as **neural style transfer**! This is a technique outlined in [Leon A. Gatys' paper, A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576), which is a great read, and you should definitely check it out. \n",
        "\n",
        "But, what is neural style transfer?\n",
        "\n",
        "Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take three images, a **content** image, a **style reference** image (such as an artwork by a famous painter), and the **input** image you want to style -- and blend them together such that the input image is transformed to look like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style image.\n",

        "The principle of neural style transfer is to define two distance functions, one that describes how different the content of two images are , $L_{content}$, and one that describes the difference between two images in terms of their style, $L_{style}$. Then, given three images, a desired style image, a desired content image, and the input image (initialized with the content image), we try to transform the input image to minimize the content distance with the content image and its style distance with the style image. \n",

As we go deeper into the model, these intermediate layers represent higher and higher order features. In this case, we are using the network architecture VGG19, a pretrained image classification network. These intermediate layers are necessary to define the representation of content and style from our images. For an input image, we will try to match the corresponding style and content target representations at these intermediate layers. \n",

At a high level, this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that in order for a network to perform image classification (which our network has been trained to do), it must understand the image. This involves taking the raw image as input pixels and building an internal representation through transformations that turn the raw image pixels into a complex understanding of the features present within the image. This is also partly why convolutional neural networks are able to generalize well: they’re able to capture the invariances and defining features within classes (e.g., cats vs. dogs) that are agnostic to background noise and other nuisances. Thus, somewhere between where the raw image is fed in and the classification label is output, the model serves as a complex feature extractor; hence by accessing intermediate layers, we’re able to describe the content and style of input images. \n",

        "  * In order to do this we had to load in a **pretrained model** and use its learned feature maps to describe the content and style representation of our images.\n",
        "    * Our main loss functions were primarily computing the distance in terms of these different representations\n",
        "* We implemented this with a custom model and **eager execution**\n",
        "  * We built our custom model with the Functional API \n",
        "  * Eager execution allows us to dynamically work with tensors, using a natural python control flow\n",
        "  * We manipulated tensors directly, which makes debugging and working with tensors easier. \n",
        "* We iteratively updated our image by applying our optimizers update rules using **tf.gradient**. The optimizer minimized a given loss with respect to our input image. "
