"""R-FCN meta-architecture definition.

R-FCN: Dai, Jifeng, et al. "R-FCN: Object Detection via Region-based
Fully Convolutional Networks." arXiv preprint arXiv:1605.06409 (2016).

The R-FCN meta architecture is similar to Faster R-CNN and only differs in the
second stage. Hence this class inherits FasterRCNNMetaArch and overrides only
the `_predict_second_stage` method.

Similar to Faster R-CNN we allow for two modes: number_of_stages=1 and
number_of_stages=2.  In the former setting, all of the user facing methods
(e.g., predict, postprocess, loss) can be used as if the model consisted
only of the RPN, returning class agnostic proposals (these can be thought of as
approximate detections with no associated class information).  In the latter
setting, proposals are computed, then passed through a second stage
"box classifier" to yield (multi-class) detections.

Implementations of R-FCN models must define a new FasterRCNNFeatureExtractor and
override three methods: `preprocess`, `_extract_proposal_features` (the first
stage of the model), and `_extract_box_classifier_features` (the second stage of
the model). Optionally, the `restore_fn` method can be overridden.  See tests
for an example.

See notes in the documentation of Faster R-CNN meta-architecture as they all
apply here.

    """RFCNMetaArch Constructor.

    Args:
      is_training: A boolean indicating whether the training version of the
        computation graph should be constructed.
      num_classes: Number of classes.  Note that num_classes *does not*
        include the background category, so if groundtruth labels take values
        in {0, 1, .., K-1}, num_classes=K (and not K+1, even though the
        assigned classification targets can range from {0,... K}).
      image_resizer_fn: A callable for image resizing.  This callable always
        takes a rank-3 image tensor (corresponding to a single image) and
        returns a rank-3 image tensor, possibly with new spatial dimensions.
        See builders/image_resizer_builder.py.
      feature_extractor: A FasterRCNNFeatureExtractor object.
      number_of_stages:  Valid values are {1, 2}. If 1 will only construct the
        Region Proposal Network (RPN) part of the model.
      first_stage_anchor_generator: An anchor_generator.AnchorGenerator object
        (note that currently we only support
        grid_anchor_generator.GridAnchorGenerator objects)
      first_stage_target_assigner: Target assigner to use for first stage of
        R-FCN (RPN).
      first_stage_atrous_rate: A single integer indicating the atrous rate for
        the single convolution op which is applied to the `rpn_features_to_crop`
        tensor to obtain a tensor to be used for box prediction. Some feature
        extractors optionally allow for producing feature maps computed at
        denser resolutions.  The atrous rate is used to compensate for the
        denser feature maps by using an effectively larger receptive field.
        (This should typically be set to 1).
      first_stage_box_predictor_arg_scope_fn: Either a
        Keras layer hyperparams object or a function to construct tf-slim
        arg_scope for conv2d, separable_conv2d and fully_connected ops. Used
        for the RPN box predictor. If it is a keras hyperparams object the
        RPN box predictor will be a Keras model. If it is a function to
        construct an arg scope it will be a tf-slim box predictor.
      first_stage_box_predictor_kernel_size: Kernel size to use for the
        convolution op just prior to RPN box predictions.
      first_stage_box_predictor_depth: Output depth for the convolution op
        just prior to RPN box predictions.
      first_stage_minibatch_size: The "batch size" to use for computing the
        objectness and location loss of the region proposal network. This
        "batch size" refers to the number of anchors selected as contributing
        to the loss function for any given image within the image batch and is
        only called "batch_size" due to terminology from the Faster R-CNN paper.
      first_stage_sampler: The sampler for the boxes used to calculate the RPN
        loss after the first stage.
      first_stage_non_max_suppression_fn: batch_multiclass_non_max_suppression
        callable that takes `boxes`, `scores` and optional `clip_window`(with
        all other inputs already set) and returns a dictionary containing
        tensors with keys: `detection_boxes`, `detection_scores`,
        `detection_classes`, `num_detections`. This is used to perform non max
        suppression  on the boxes predicted by the Region Proposal Network
        (RPN).
        See `post_processing.batch_multiclass_non_max_suppression` for the type
        and shape of these tensors.
      first_stage_max_proposals: Maximum number of boxes to retain after
        performing Non-Max Suppression (NMS) on the boxes predicted by the
        Region Proposal Network (RPN).
      first_stage_localization_loss_weight: A float
      first_stage_objectness_loss_weight: A float
      crop_and_resize_fn: A differentiable resampler to use for cropping RPN
        proposal features.
      second_stage_target_assigner: Target assigner to use for second stage of
        R-FCN. If the model is configured with multiple prediction heads, this
        target assigner is used to generate targets for all heads (with the
        correct `unmatched_class_label`).
      second_stage_rfcn_box_predictor: RFCN box predictor to use for
        second stage.
      second_stage_batch_size: The batch size used for computing the
        classification and refined location loss of the box classifier.  This
        "batch size" refers to the number of proposals selected as contributing
        to the loss function for any given image within the image batch and is
        only called "batch_size" due to terminology from the Faster R-CNN paper.
      second_stage_sampler: The sampler for the boxes used for second stage
        box classifier.
      second_stage_non_max_suppression_fn: batch_multiclass_non_max_suppression
        callable that takes `boxes`, `scores`, optional `clip_window` and
        optional (kwarg) `mask` inputs (with all other inputs already set)
        and returns a dictionary containing tensors with keys:
        `detection_boxes`, `detection_scores`, `detection_classes`,
        `num_detections`, and (optionally) `detection_masks`. See
        `post_processing.batch_multiclass_non_max_suppression` for the type and
        shape of these tensors.
      second_stage_score_conversion_fn: Callable elementwise nonlinearity
        (that takes tensors as inputs and returns tensors).  This is usually
        used to convert logits to probabilities.
      second_stage_localization_loss_weight: A float
      second_stage_classification_loss_weight: A float
      second_stage_classification_loss: A string indicating which loss function
        to use, supports 'softmax' and 'sigmoid'.
      hard_example_miner:  A losses.HardExampleMiner object (can be None).
      parallel_iterations: (Optional) The number of iterations allowed to run
        in parallel for calls to tf.map_fn.
      add_summaries: boolean (default: True) controlling whether summary ops
        should be added to tensorflow graph.
      clip_anchors_to_image: The anchors generated are clip to the
        window size without filtering the nonoverlapping anchors. This generates
        a static number of anchors. This argument is unused.
      use_static_shapes: If True, uses implementation of ops with static shape
        guarantees.
      resize_masks: Indicates whether the masks presend in the groundtruth
        should be resized in the model with `image_resizer_fn`
      freeze_batchnorm: Whether to freeze batch norm parameters during
        training or not. When training with a small batch size (e.g. 1), it is
        desirable to freeze batch norm update and use pretrained batch norm
        params.
      return_raw_detections_during_predict: Whether to return raw detection
        boxes in the predict() method. These are decoded boxes that have not
        been through postprocessing (i.e. NMS). Default False.
      output_final_box_features: Whether to output final box features. If true,
        it crops the feature map based on the final box prediction and returns
        it in the dict as detection_features.
      output_final_box_rpn_features: Whether to output rpn box features. If
        true, it crops the rpn feature map based on the final box prediction and
        returns it in the dict as detection_features.

    Raises:
      ValueError: If `second_stage_batch_size` > `first_stage_max_proposals`
      ValueError: If first_stage_anchor_generator is not of type
        grid_anchor_generator.GridAnchorGenerator.
