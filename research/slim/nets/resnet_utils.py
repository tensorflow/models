"""Contains building blocks for various versions of Residual Networks.

Residual networks (ResNets) were proposed in:
  Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun
  Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition. arXiv:1512.03385, 2015

More variants were introduced in:
  Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun
  Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks. arXiv: 1603.05027, 2016

We can obtain different ResNet variants by changing the network depth, width,
and form of residual unit. This module implements the infrastructure for
building them. Concrete ResNet units and full ResNet networks are implemented in
the accompanying resnet_v1.py and resnet_v2.py modules.

Compared to https://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks, in the current
implementation we subsample the output activations in the last residual unit of
each block, instead of subsampling the input activations in the first residual
unit of each block. The two implementations give identical results but our
implementation is more memory efficient.

  """Stacks ResNet `Blocks` and controls output feature density.

  First, this function creates scopes for the ResNet in the form of
  'block_name/unit_1', 'block_name/unit_2', etc.

  Second, this function allows the user to explicitly control the ResNet
  output_stride, which is the ratio of the input to output spatial resolution.
  This is useful for dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation or
  object detection.

  Most ResNets consist of 4 ResNet blocks and subsample the activations by a
  factor of 2 when transitioning between consecutive ResNet blocks. This results
  to a nominal ResNet output_stride equal to 8. If we set the output_stride to
  half the nominal network stride (e.g., output_stride=4), then we compute
  responses twice.

  Control of the output feature density is implemented by atrous convolution.

  Args:
    net: A `Tensor` of size [batch, height, width, channels].
    blocks: A list of length equal to the number of ResNet `Blocks`. Each
      element is a ResNet `Block` object describing the units in the `Block`.
    output_stride: If `None`, then the output will be computed at the nominal
      network stride. If output_stride is not `None`, it specifies the requested
      ratio of input to output spatial resolution, which needs to be equal to
      the product of unit strides from the start up to some level of the ResNet.
      For example, if the ResNet employs units with strides 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1,
      then valid values for the output_stride are 1, 2, 6, 24 or None (which
      is equivalent to output_stride=24).
    store_non_strided_activations: If True, we compute non-strided (undecimated)
      activations at the last unit of each block and store them in the
      `outputs_collections` before subsampling them. This gives us access to
      higher resolution intermediate activations which are useful in some
      dense prediction problems but increases 4x the computation and memory cost
      at the last unit of each block.
    outputs_collections: Collection to add the ResNet block outputs.
