Specifies:
  InputDataFields: standard fields used by reader/preprocessor/batcher.
  DetectionResultFields: standard fields returned by object detector.
  BoxListFields: standard field used by BoxList
  TfExampleFields: standard fields for tf-example data format (go/tf-example).

class InputDataFields(object):
  """Names for the input tensors.

  Holds the standard data field names to use for identifying input tensors. This
  should be used by the decoder to identify keys for the returned tensor_dict
  containing input tensors. And it should be used by the model to identify the
  tensors it needs.

  Attributes:
    image: image.
    image_additional_channels: additional channels.
    original_image: image in the original input size.
    key: unique key corresponding to image.
    source_id: source of the original image.

    groundtruth_image_classes: image-level class labels.
    groundtruth_boxes: coordinates of the ground truth boxes in the image.
    groundtruth_classes: box-level class labels.
    groundtruth_label_types: box-level label types (e.g. explicit negative).
    groundtruth_is_crowd: [DEPRECATED, use groundtruth_group_of instead]
      is the groundtruth a single object or a crowd.
    groundtruth_area: area of a groundtruth segment.
    groundtruth_difficult: is a `difficult` object
    groundtruth_group_of: is a `group_of` objects, e.g. multiple objects of the
      same class, forming a connected group, where instances are heavily
      occluding each other.
    proposal_boxes: coordinates of object proposal boxes.
    proposal_objectness: objectness score of each proposal.
    groundtruth_instance_masks: ground truth instance masks.
    groundtruth_instance_boundaries: ground truth instance boundaries.
    groundtruth_instance_classes: instance mask-level class labels.
    groundtruth_keypoints: ground truth keypoints.
    groundtruth_keypoint_visibilities: ground truth keypoint visibilities.

    groundtruth_weights: groundtruth weight factor for bounding boxes.
    num_groundtruth_boxes: number of groundtruth boxes.
    true_image_shapes: true shapes of images in the resized images, as resized
      images can be padded with zeros.
    multiclass_scores: the label score per class for each box.
