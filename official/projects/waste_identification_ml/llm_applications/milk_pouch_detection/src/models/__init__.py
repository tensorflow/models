"""Model clients and weights for computer vision and LLM inference.

This package contains:
  - Python client classes for model inference
  - Pre-trained model weights organized by model type

Structure:
  - classification.py: ImageClassifier (ViT-B/16)
  - detection_segmentation.py: ObjectDetectionSegmentation (Grounding DINO +
  SAM2)
  - llm.py: LlmModels (using Ollama interface)

  - grounding_dino_model/: Grounding DINO weights and config
  - sam2_model/: SAM2 weights
  - image_classifier_model/: Fine-tuned ViT classifier weights
