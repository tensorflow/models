The adequate specifications, such as sensor size, lens, height, or shutter
speed, depend entirely on your facility's requirements.

Conducting a complete engineering analysis is necessary for a thorough
understanding of your facility's conditions. This includes factors like the size
of objects on the conveyor belt, the speed of the belt, the positioning of the
camera, and lighting conditions. However, the following table provides a
summarized overview that can aid in the initial camera selection process.
