The following list contains the essential recommendations when selecting a
camera to capture high-quality images:

-  **Frame rate:** Ensure the camera can capture images at a high frame rate,
   matching the speed of the conveyor belt to avoid motion blurriness. Look for
   cameras with at least 30 FPS (frames per second) or higher.
-  **Shutter type:** A global shutter is preferable over a rolling shutter to
   avoid distortion, especially for fast-moving objects.
-  **Lens compatibility:** Choose a camera with interchangeable lenses to adjust
   the field of view and focus based on the conveyor belt width and object size.
-  **Interface:** Select a camera with an appropriate interface (for example,
   USB 3.0, GigE, or Camera Link) that supports high-speed data transfer to the
   processing unit.
-  **Integration with software libraries:** Verify compatibility with software
   and libraries for seamless integration. For example, if you are using an edge
   device, such as NVIDIA or Raspberry Pi, you need software integration
   compatibility with it.
-  **Scan type:** An area scan camera is preferable over a line scan camera to
   ensure flexibility and comprehensive imaging capabilities required to
   identify varying waste materials effectively. Area scan cameras are suitable
   when objects vary significantly in size and shape and for situations where
   the conveyor belt speed varies or is not uniform.
-  **Resolution:** A suitable resolution is crucial for image analysis because
   it corresponds to the level of detail, patterns, and textures a camera can
   detect from an object. You must have an image resolution of at least
   1024x1024 pixels. For this reason, choose a camera with a resolution between
   0.5 and 1.0 MP (megapixels), depending on the size of the objects and the
   level of detail required.

The higher the pixel resolution, the more processing time and latency are
introduced by having to process all those pixels through the model. Find a
balance between image resolution and processing latency.

The following list contains additional factors you might want to consider based
on your facility's conditions:

-  **Enclosure:** Ensure the camera has an industrial-grade enclosure,
   preferably NEMA, IP65, or higher, to withstand harsh environments and dust.
   For example, [Basler has some offerings](https://www.baslerweb.com/en/products/accessories-and-bundles/basler-ip67-housing/).
-  **Lighting:** Ensure diffused or even lighting across all items on the
   conveyor belt. If the conveyor belt's speed is high, you need a smaller
   [aperture size](./factors/#aperture-size-f-number) and a higher [shutter
   speed](./factors/#shutter-speed). The conveyor belt should be well-lit to
   ensure bright images, reducing blurriness.
-  **Parameter control:** Opt for a camera with good low-light sensitivity and
   high dynamic range to handle varying lighting conditions. Look for cameras
   with adjustable exposure settings to accommodate different lighting
   conditions and object speeds. Also, choose a camera that supports remote
   configuration for tuning software parameters such as shutter speed, exposure,
   and frame rate.
-  **Mounting options:** Ensure you have flexible mounting options to position
   the camera correctly above the conveyor belt. Review different mount
   accessories for the camera to ensure a safe, fixed, and stable assembly.
-  **Integrated lightning:** Accompany the camera with an integrated lightning
   system to reach the required luminosity in your facility. You can find
   accessories such as lightning bulbs or lamps to increase the brightness of
   the conveyor belt.
-  **Synchronization:** If you need multiple cameras, ensure they can be
   synchronized to capture images simultaneously.
-  **Power supply:** Consider power over ethernet (PoE).
-  **Temperature range:** Verify the camera can operate within the temperature
   range of the recycling facility.
-  **Reliability and durability:** Choose cameras with a proven track record for
   reliability and durability in industrial applications.
