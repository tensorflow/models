## Use cases for CircularNet

While you can deploy the fundamental technology underpinning CircularNet in
various areas across the waste management ecosystem, CircularNet has been
trained on and designed for deployment in material recovery facilities (MRFs)
and recycling facilities. Typical users include MRF and recycling operators,
technology integrators, system and machine learning engineers, and academic
researchers. Examples of solutions you can implement through CircularNet
include:

-  Bale quality analysis
-  Residual line analytics
-  Identification of recyclable materials and contaminants in mixed waste
   streams
-  Recycling and contamination reporting in MRF facilities
