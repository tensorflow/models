# Quick Start: Jupyter notebook for off-the-shelf inference

If you'd like to hit the ground running and run detection on a few example
images right out of the box, we recommend trying out the Jupyter notebook demo.
To run the Jupyter notebook, run the following command from
`tensorflow/models/object_detection`:

```
# From tensorflow/models/object_detection
jupyter notebook
```

The notebook should open in your favorite web browser. Click the
[`object_detection_tutorial.ipynb`](../object_detection_tutorial.ipynb) link to
open the demo.
