# Tensorflow Object Detection API
Creating accurate machine learning models capable of localizing and identifying
multiple objects in a single image remains a core challenge in computer vision.
The TensorFlow Object Detection API is an open source framework built on top of
TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection
models.  At Google weâ€™ve certainly found this codebase to be useful for our
computer vision needs, and we hope that you will as well.

Contributions to the codebase are welcome and we would love to hear back from
you if you find this API useful.  Finally if you use the Tensorflow Object
Detection API for a research publication, please consider citing:

## Getting Help

Please report bugs to the tensorflow/models/ Github
[issue tracker](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues), prefixing the
issue name with "object_detection". To get help with issues you may encounter
using the Tensorflow Object Detection API, create a new question on
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) with the tags "tensorflow" and
"object-detection".

## Release information

### August 11, 2017

We have released an update to the [Android Detect
demo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android)
which will now run models trained using the Tensorflow Object
Detection API on an Android device.  By default, it currently runs a
frozen SSD w/Mobilenet detector trained on COCO, but we encourage
you to try out other detection models!

<b>Thanks to contributors</b>: Jonathan Huang, Andrew Harp

### June 15, 2017

In addition to our base Tensorflow detection model definitions, this
release includes:

* A selection of trainable detection models, including:
  * Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) with MobileNet,
  * SSD with Inception V2,
  * Region-Based Fully Convolutional Networks (R-FCN) with Resnet 101,
  * Faster RCNN with Resnet 101,
  * Faster RCNN with Inception Resnet v2
* Frozen weights (trained on the COCO dataset) for each of the above models to
  be used for out-of-the-box inference purposes.
* A [Jupyter notebook](object_detection_tutorial.ipynb) for performing
  out-of-the-box inference with one of our released models
* Convenient [local training](g3doc/running_locally.md) scripts as well as
  distributed training and evaluation pipelines via
  [Google Cloud](g3doc/running_on_cloud.md).
